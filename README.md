<h1>SymbiChat</h1>

This is the college project I made for the final year. This is a messaging app which uses <b>Google Firebase API</b> to get live updates on your messages.
It was made using Android Studio and the student version of the Google Firebase Cloud service. It has a custom UI made by me and works live.
